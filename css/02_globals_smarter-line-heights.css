/*
Ideally, we could use a formula for line height that yields tighter lines for larger font sizes, avoiding the overly fluffy headers that come from using a fixed line height of 1.5.
*/

/*
Option 1:

Use the font size as the base, then add a little extra space.

This is applied with *, instead of being applied to the body, because the em unit doesn't inherit well, and
will not be recalculated for every element.

This can cause issues when third-party code assumes
that line heights are inheritable, since they usually are.
*/

* {
  line-height: calc(1em + 0.5rem);
}

/*
Option 2:

Use the ex unit (the current font's x-height) as the base, then add a little extra space on each side.

The rule is applied to all descendants because using a plain * would mean that line-height on the descendant is determined using the parent's font size, rather than the descendant's font size.

.parent * {
  line-height: calc(2px + 2ex + 2px);
