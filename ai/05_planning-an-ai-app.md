# Planning an AI application

## Key ways AI can be used in a product

### Critical or complementary

If an app can still work without AI, AI is complementary. In contrast, critical AI needs to be more accurate and reliable. People are more accepting of mistakes from complementary AI.

### Reactive or proactive

Does the AI respond to user requests, or does it offer things to the user without them asking, such as a traffic alert on Google maps?

Reactive features need to be fast, whereas proactive features can be precomputed and shown opportunistically.

Proactive features typically have a higher quality bar, since they might be viewed as intrusive otherwise.

### Dynamic or static

Dynamic features are updated continually. For example, Face ID needs to be updated as people's faces change over time. Each user might have their own model, whereas static features can have one model for the entire group of users.

## Last mile challenge

Initial success with foundation models is misleading. "The journey from 0 to 60 is easy, whereas progressing from 60 to 100 becomes exceedingly challenging."

## Maintenance

Maintenance of an AI app can be challenging because of how fast AI is moving, and it will continue to move fast for the next decade.

## Obsolescence

Some changes to evolving models can be fatal. The feature you're building may become a built-in feature of the model. Legality issues can also arise around IP.
