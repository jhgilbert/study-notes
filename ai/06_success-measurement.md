## Success measurement

- **TTFT** means "time to first token".
- **TPOT** means "time per output token".
- **Total latency** is the amount of time taken for each request. Acceptable latency depends on your use case.
- **Cost metrics** measure the cost per inference request.

Other metrics can be used, such as interpretability and fairness.
