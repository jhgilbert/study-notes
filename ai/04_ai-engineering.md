# AI engineering

AI engineering leverages existing models, incorporating them into applications. Foundation models especially require a lot of resources to develop, so the process is often only possible for big corporations such as Google and Meta.

## Model as a service

AI engineering is becoming easier thanks to the "model as a service" approach popularized by OpenAI and other providers. Without this approach, you would have to create your own infrastructure to host and serve your own AI model.

In this approach, models are exposed via APIs that receive user queries and return model outputs.

## Open-source AI engineering tools

AutoGPT, Stable Diffusion eb UI, LangChain, and Ollama are four tools that are on track to become more popular than web development frameworks such as React.
